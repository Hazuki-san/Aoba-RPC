4. **Navigate to [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/) and open a chapter, any chapter.**
    - Once you open a chapter, a browser notification should appear (after prompting you to allow notifications) to notify you that a DPS connection has been established for that manga.
    - At the same time, if you take a look at the DPS console, you should see it greeting you with a welcome message, such as: `Welcome username#discriminator`

**Note #1:** Your status on Discord must not be set to invisible/offline, otherwise the Rich Presence won't appear.

**Note #2:** If the Rich Presence doesn't appear even though your status isn't set to invisible/offline, then reload Discord.

### FAQ
> Firefox is giving me a "Security Error: The operation is insecure." error?
- Firefox does not allow, by default, going from a secure endpoint (https://) to a non-secure one (ws://). This can be disabled by going to `about:config` and changing `network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS` to `true`.

> I tried to run the DPS JAR but it's giving me some error about tray icons?
- This usually happens if you're using GNOME without the indicators extension installed and enabled.

> I don't really like Tampermonkey, can't I use GM or VM?
- You can use whichever injector you're most comfortable with, I just tend to prefer working with TM.

> Why not include the manga's cover photo in the RPC?
- Unfortunately, that can't be done. RPC assets have to be set in the application's dashboard and are limited to 150 items. Should Discord support an alternative method in the future, I will update the script accordingly.

> Why do I have to download and run some JAR file to get this thing to work? It's so inconvenient!
- Unfortunately, this is the only way to offer an RPC plugin right now. Believe me, I hate adding inconvenient steps to my work just as much as you hate going through them. I can't make any promises but I am studying a few alternative methods for RPC/DPS integration.
